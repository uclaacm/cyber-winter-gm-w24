  I've been having visions about my former life, but I can't seem to recall any specifics. The only thing I can remember is this poem:
  
  On the dimly lit court,
  his eyes held secrets that echoed the hardwood battles of his past life,
  where he once danced with giants and soared among the stars,
  leaving only echoes of his name in the arena's rafters.
  
  In the digital shadows,
  an enigmatic Instagram account beckoned like an unopened treasure chest,
  offering glimpses into a hidden world where secrets and wonders lay waiting,
  yet his name remains a mystery,
  known only to be connected loosely with the author of this challenge.
