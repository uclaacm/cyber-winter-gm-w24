  I wish I could turn back time and see what photo my favorite stargazing blogger posted on [https://zhamic7.github.io/starry-night](https://zhamic7.github.io/starry-night)... 

  Maybe there's a site that archives all of these websites online and would allow you to go way back?

  Hint: once you find the archive, the flag is in the image. You may have to download the image to see it.
