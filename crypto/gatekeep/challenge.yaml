  I really like trains. I wanted to take a visit to an abandoned junkyard containing a lot of vintage trains. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past its barbed wire fence. I found a piece of paper outside though, with some weird gibberish on it: `ISOLNATOOINOVADDERYUTO`. I think it's some kind of cipher, maybe related to trains? What does it mean?

  Wrap the answer in `cyber{}` and make sure it is all lowercase before submitting.
