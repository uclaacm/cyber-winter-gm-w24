  This challenge is from LA CTF 2023. The difficulty is significantly higher than the other forensic challenges here, but write-ups of this challenge do exist online if you get stuck!

  We managed to get ahold of a flash drive which we think contains the decryption keys for the ransomware that a hacker group tried to deploy on our computer network! However, it seems like the hacker encrypted the flash drive. We know that the organization uses passwords in the format hacker### (hacker + 3 digits) for their disks, but a much stronger encryption password once you login. Can you try to get access to their notes?
